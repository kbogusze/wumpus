YOU ARE A FAMOUS HUNTER DESCENDING DOWN INTO THE CAVES OF DARKNESS,
LAIR OF THE INFAMOUS MAN-EATING WUMPUS.  YOU ARE EQUIPPED WITH FIVE
BENT ARROWS, AND ALL YOUR SENSES.  THERE ARE 3 x LEVEL CAVES
CONNECTED BY TUNNELS, AND THERE ARE HAZARD LIKE:

        A) PITS, WHICH ARE BOTTOMLESS, AND USUALLY FATAL TO FALL
        INTO.  THERE ARE 3 x LEVELS PITS IN THE NETWORK.


IF YOU BLUNDER INTO THE SAME ROOM AS THE WUMPUS, YOU LOSE....
THE NORMALLY SLEEPING WUMPUS DOES NOT MOVE (HAVING GORGED HIMSELF UPON
A PREVIOUS HUNTER).  HOWEVER SEVERAL THINGS CAN WAKE HIM UP:

        1) WALKING INTO HIS ROOM,
        2) SHOOTING AN ARROW ANYWHERE IN THE NETWORK,

IF HE WAKES UP THERE'S A POSSIBILITY HE WILL MOVE, HOWEVER, HE'S TOO
LAZY TO MOVE. HE HAS SUCKER FEET, SO HE DOESN'T FALL INTO THE PITS.

YOU CAN SMELL THE WUMPUS FROM ONE ROOMS AWAY.  YOU WILL
TREMBLE WITH FEAR WHEN HE MOVES ABOUT, AND FEEL BREEZE
(FROM BOTTOMLESS PITS) FROM ONE ROOM AWAY (AND TASTE THE FEAR...).

TO SHOOT AN ARROW TYPE "SPACE" INSTEAD OF A MOVE, IF YOU KILL
THE WUMPUS YOU CAN PASS TO NEXT LEVEL.

YOU CAN FIND GOLD CASKET ON YOUR WAY, YOU HAVE TO FIND IT
TO PROCEED TO NEXT LEVEL.

EACH ROOM IS CONNECTED TO THREE OTHER ROOMS BY THREE TUNNELS A, B
AND C.  YOU MUST ALWAYS MOVE BETWEEN ROOMS BY SPECIFYING WHICH
TUNNEL YOU WISH TO EXPLORE.  YOU CAN ALWAYS RETRACE YOUR FOOT STEPS
BY MOVING BACK USING THE SAME TUNNEL DESIGNATOR.


GOOD LUCK HUNTING AND HAVE LOT OF FUN!!
