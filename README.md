# HUNT THE WUMPUS GAME
======
My own implementation of old school game "HUNT THE WUMPUS" from 70s. Hunt the Wumpus is a text-based adventure game, the turn-based game has the player trying to avoid fatal bottomless pits. The goal is to fire one of their "crooked arrows" through the caves to kill the Wumpus.
